# Design Pattern Categorization

Design Patters are typically split into three categories after Erich Gamma, one of the Gang of Four Design Patterns authors, this is called `Gamma Categorization`.

1. Creational Patterns

- deal with the construction/creation of objects
- implicit (Dependency Injection, reflection, and more) vs. explicit (constructor)
- wholesale (one single statement to construct an object) vs. piecewise (step-by-step creation (builder-facets))

2. Structural Patterns

- concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
- many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
- stress the importance of good API design

3. Behavioral Patterns

- they are all different - no general theme
